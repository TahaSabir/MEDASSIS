# Healthcare Translation Web App

This is a prototype Healthcare Translation Web App built with open-source tools. It includes:

- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** (stubbed; integrate an open-source STT engine as needed)
- **Translation:** Uses Medical mT5 (HiTZ/Medical-mT5-large) for multilingual medical translation.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Uses Coqui TTS to generate audio from text.
- **Frontend:** A simple React-based mobile-first interface.
